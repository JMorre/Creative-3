  <p class="intro">Fight as a gladiator in the coliseum, in this extremely shallow combat game.<br><br>
    This game uses a Vue app to store all game variables and states, and modifies, displays, and progresses based on user input.<br><br>
    Every round starts you with full health and stamina.  You gain a strength point and level each round you beat.<br>
    Your agility helps you defend against hits, your strength increases your damage, and your speed improves the agility boost that comes from evading.  You must rest if your stamina is too low.  Every turn you and your enemy will take an action.
